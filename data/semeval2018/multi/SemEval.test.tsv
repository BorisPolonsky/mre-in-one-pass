this paper , we discuss lemma identification in Japanese morphological analysis , which is crucial for variation in orthography and the vocabulary of Japanese consists of words of several different origins , happens that more than one writing form corresponds to the same lemma and that a single writing form corresponds to two or more lemmas with different readings and/or meanings a lemma is important in linguistic analysis of corpora . The current study focuses on disambiguation of heteronyms , words with the same information , the classification of words based on their origin . Founded on the fact that words of some goshu classes are more likely to combine into compound words than words of other classes , we employ a statistical model based on CRFs using goshu information . Experimental show that the use of goshu information considerably improves the performance of heteronym disambiguation and lemma identification , suggesting that goshu information solves the lemma identification task very effectively .
